# scripts/qualify-sdk.sh — behavioral qualification for native agentic-SDK
# bump PRs (@openai/codex-sdk, @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk).
#
# CI typechecks and unit-tests these bumps but cannot exercise the native
# adapters (they need subscription auth), so this script runs the missing
# layer locally: the full test suite plus a live `neal compat --role all`
# pass-through on the bumped adapter, using the Claude/Codex CLI auth already
# present on this machine. On PASS it posts the compat matrix to the PR as an
# approving review, or as a comment review when the PR is your own (GitHub
# won't let you approve your own PR; a manual bump from
# scripts/bump-native-sdks.sh is one of those). On FAIL it posts the evidence
# and leaves the PR open.
#
# Usage: scripts/qualify-sdk.sh <pr-number>
#
# On PASS the PR is approved but left open; release it with
# scripts/release-sdk-bump.sh, which merges it as part of the release.
#
# Requirements: gh (authenticated), node + pnpm on PATH, and the relevant
# provider CLI logged in (claude / codex). Runs in a throwaway git worktree —
# this checkout's branch, node_modules, and dist are not touched.
